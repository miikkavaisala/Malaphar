# Malaphar
A toolkit for scientific data visualization. 

Intended to be a collection of methods and tools particularly in connection
with, but not limited to, the Astaroth code, see www.gputurbulence.fi/astaroth/
. This is still a work in progress. Please check out the Astaroth repository
for more context. 

So far anything here is set of demos and tools of data-analysis and visulization.
